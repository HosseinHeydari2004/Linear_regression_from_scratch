# 📈 Linear Regression From Scratch

This project is an implementation of **Linear Regression from scratch** using Python, without relying on machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`.

The main goal is to deeply understand the **mathematics and mechanics** behind linear regression, cost functions, and gradient descent.
